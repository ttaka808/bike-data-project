# bike-data-project

This project was submitted by Trevor Taka and Lucas Brookes for our final project in ECE 20875, Python for Data Science at Purdue University in Spring 2021.

For this project, we analyzed a data set, which captured bike usage in different locations in New York City in 2016, as well as created Python data models to determine bike traffic across several different bridges, predict traffic on specific days, and predict whether or not it was raining based on bike traffic.
